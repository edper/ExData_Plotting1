### Exploratory Data Analysis plotting project 
### Johns Hopkins University under Coursera

This is in fullfilment for the required plotting project in Exploratory Data Analysis by Johns Hopkins University under Coursera.

And the steps below are how to run and check my work.

1. Download link for [Electric Power Consumption](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) dataset required in this project **if you have not done so**.
2. Copy to the current working directory of your R-Studio
3. Unzip the text file in the current working directory of your R-Studio
4. Download **plot1.R**, **plot2.R**, **plot3.R** and **plot4.R** files and move it to the current working directory of your R-Studio
5. Download **plot1.png**, **plot2.png**, **plot3.png** and **plot4.png** to any directory of your choice. And review each image if it match the requirement.
6. Run **plot1.R**, **plot2.R**, **plot3.R** and **plot4.R** individually in your R-Studio using **source()** command.
7. Check if the generated images, namely, **plot1.png**, **plot2.png**, **plot3.png** and **plot4.png** in the current working directory of your R-Studio match the requirement.
